## What is Git?

Git is a **version control system (VCS)** that tracks changes to your files over time. It lets you:

- See what changed, when, and by whom
- Revert to previous versions if something breaks
- Work on features in isolation using branches
- Collaborate with others without overwriting each other's work

Git runs locally on your machine. **GitHub**, **GitLab**, and **Bitbucket** are remote servers that host Git repositories, enabling collaboration and backup.

---

## Initial Setup

Configure your identity. Git attaches this information to every commit you make.

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

To verify your configuration:

```bash
git config --list
```

---

## Repository Basics

### Initialize a Repository

```bash
git init
```

This creates a hidden `.git` folder that tracks all changes. Run this in your project's root directory.

### Check Status

```bash
git status
```

Shows which files have changed, which are staged for commit, and which are untracked.

Example output:

```
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  modified:   index.js

Untracked files:
  utils.js
```

---

## The Staging Area

Git has a two-step process for saving changes:

1. **Stage**: Mark files you want to include in the next commit
2. **Commit**: Save the staged changes as a snapshot

Think of staging as preparing a package before shipping it.

### Stage Files

```bash
# Stage a specific file
git add index.js

# Stage multiple files
git add index.js utils.js

# Stage all changes
git add .
```

### View Changes Before Staging

```bash
git diff
```

Shows line-by-line changes. Press `q` to exit.

Example output:

```diff
- const name = "old";
+ const name = "new";
```

Lines starting with `-` were removed. Lines starting with `+` were added.

### Remove a File

```bash
git rm filename.js
```

Removes the file from both your working directory and Git tracking.

---

## Commits

A commit is a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time. Each commit has:

- A unique ID (SHA hash)
- Author information
- Timestamp
- A message describing the change

### Create a Commit

```bash
git commit -m "Add user authentication"
```

The message should describe **what** the change does, not how.

### View Commit History

```bash
# Full history
git log

# Compact one-line format
git log --oneline
```

Example `git log --oneline` output:

```
a1b2c3d Add user authentication
e4f5g6h Fix login bug
i7j8k9l Initial commit
```

### Inspect a Specific Commit

```bash
git show a1b2c3d
```

Shows the full details of that commit, including the diff.

### See Who Changed Each Line

```bash
git blame index.js
```

Shows the commit SHA, author, and timestamp for each line of a file. Useful for understanding why code exists.

---

## Understanding Commits as a Chain

Git commits form a linked list. Each commit points to its parent (the previous commit).

```
[Initial] --> [Add feature] --> [Fix bug] --> [Update docs]
                                                    ^
                                                   HEAD
```

**HEAD** is a pointer to your current position in the commit history, typically the latest commit on your branch.

---

## Undoing Changes

### Reset: Rewrite History

`git reset` moves HEAD to a different commit, effectively removing commits from history.

```bash
git reset --hard a1b2c3d
```

This moves HEAD to commit `a1b2c3d` and **discards all changes** after it. The commits are gone from your history.

| Flag | What Happens to Changes |
|------|------------------------|
| `--soft` | Keeps changes staged |
| `--mixed` | Keeps changes unstaged (default) |
| `--hard` | Discards changes completely |

### Revert: Safe Undo

`git revert` creates a new commit that undoes a specific commit without erasing history.

```bash
git revert a1b2c3d
```

Before revert:

```
[A] --> [B] --> [C]
                 ^
                HEAD
```

After reverting commit B:

```
[A] --> [B] --> [C] --> [Revert B]
                             ^
                            HEAD
```

The original commits remain intact. Use revert when working with shared branches.

| Command | Modifies History | Safe for Shared Branches |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| `git reset` | Yes | No |
| `git revert` | No | Yes |

---

## Branches

Branches let you work on features or fixes in isolation without affecting the main codebase.

### View Branches

```bash
git branch
```

The current branch is marked with `*`.

### Create a Branch

```bash
git branch feature-login
```

### Switch Branches

```bash
git checkout feature-login
```

### Create and Switch in One Command

```bash
git checkout -b feature-login
```

### Rename a Branch

```bash
git branch -m master main
```

### Branch Naming Conventions

| Prefix | Purpose | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `feature/` | New functionality | `feature/user-auth` |
| `fix/` | Bug fixes | `fix/login-crash` |
| `hotfix/` | Urgent production fixes | `hotfix/security-patch` |
| `docs/` | Documentation changes | `docs/api-reference` |

---

## Merging

Merging combines changes from one branch into another.

### Basic Merge

```bash
# Switch to the branch you want to merge INTO
git checkout main

# Merge the feature branch
git merge feature-login
```

This creates a merge commit that combines both branches:

```
main:    [A] --> [B] -----------> [Merge]
                   \             /
feature:            [C] --> [D]
```

### Merge vs Rebase

**Merge** creates a merge commit, preserving the branch structure:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature-login
```

**Rebase** replays your commits on top of another branch, creating a linear history:

```bash
git checkout feature-login
git rebase main
git checkout main
git merge feature-login
```

Before rebase:

```
main:    [A] --> [B]
                   \
feature:            [C] --> [D]
```

After rebase:

```
main:    [A] --> [B] --> [C'] --> [D']
```

| Approach | History | Use When |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Merge | Non-linear, shows branch structure | Preserving context of feature branches |
| Rebase | Linear, cleaner | Keeping history clean before merging |

Rebase rewrites commit history. Never rebase commits that have been pushed to a shared branch.

---

## Remote Repositories

A **remote** is a copy of your repository hosted on a server. It enables collaboration and backup.

### Add a Remote

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git
```

- `origin` is the conventional name for your primary remote
- You can add multiple remotes with different names

### View Remotes

```bash
git remote -v
```

### Push to Remote

```bash
git push origin main
```

Sends your local `main` branch to the `origin` remote.

### The -u Flag

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

The `-u` (or `--set-upstream`) flag sets up tracking between your local and remote branch. After this, you can simply use:

```bash
git push
git pull
```

Without specifying the remote and branch each time.

### Push with Different Branch Names

If your local branch is `master` but you want to push it as `main` on the remote:

```bash
git push -u origin master:main
```

### Pull Changes

```bash
git pull origin main
```

Fetches changes from the remote and merges them into your local branch.

---

## SSH Authentication

GitHub repositories are protected. You authenticate using SSH keys.

### How SSH Works

1. Generate a key pair on your local machine (public + private)
2. Add the public key to your GitHub account
3. Git uses the private key (never shared) to prove your identity

### Generate SSH Keys

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your.email@example.com"
```

This creates two files:

- `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` (private key - never share)
- `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` (public key - add to GitHub)

### Add Public Key to GitHub

1. Copy your public key: `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`
2. Go to GitHub Settings > SSH and GPG keys
3. Click "New SSH key" and paste the key

### Test the Connection

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

---

## Stashing

Stash temporarily saves your uncommitted changes so you can switch branches without committing incomplete work.

### Save Changes to Stash

```bash
git stash
```

Your working directory is now clean, and changes are saved in the stash.

### View Stashed Changes

```bash
git stash list
```

Output:

```
stash@{0}: WIP on feature-login: a1b2c3d Add login form
stash@{1}: WIP on main: e4f5g6h Update readme
```

### Restore Stashed Changes

```bash
# Apply and keep in stash
git stash apply

# Apply and remove from stash
git stash pop

# Apply a specific stash
git stash apply stash@{1}
```

### Discard a Stash

```bash
# Remove the most recent stash
git stash drop

# Remove a specific stash
git stash drop stash@{1}

# Clear all stashes
git stash clear
```

---

## Common Workflows

### Starting a New Feature

```bash
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"
git push -u origin feature/new-feature
```

Then create a Pull Request on GitHub.

### Updating Your Branch with Main

```bash
git checkout feature/new-feature
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main
# Or: git rebase origin/main
```

### Reviewing a Pull Request Locally

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout origin/feature-branch
```
