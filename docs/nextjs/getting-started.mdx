## Why Next.js?

Next.js was created to solve several pain points in React development:

| Problem | In React | In Next.js |
|---------|----------|------------|
| **API Routes** | Separate backend project | Built-in API routes |
| **Routing** | Requires `react-router-dom` | File-based routing |
| **SEO** | Client-rendered, poor SEO | Server-rendered, SEO-friendly |
| **Data Fetching** | Waterfall requests on client | Server-side data fetching |

## What Next.js Offers

### Advantages

1. **Server-Side Rendering** — HTML is generated on the server, solving SEO issues
2. **API Routes** — Full-stack in a single codebase (frontend + backend)
3. **File-Based Routing** — No router configuration needed
4. **Performance Optimizations** — Automatic code splitting, image optimization, static generation
5. **Vercel Support** — Maintained by Vercel with excellent deployment integration

### Trade-offs

1. **Requires a Server** — Can't be deployed as static files to a CDN (unless using static export). Server-side rendering needs compute resources
2. **Opinionated** — Strong conventions make it harder to migrate away from Next.js

## Creating a Project

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

This interactive CLI will ask you about:
- TypeScript support
- ESLint configuration
- Tailwind CSS
- App Router vs Pages Router
- Import aliases

## File-Based Routing

Next.js uses the filesystem to define routes. The structure of your `app` directory directly maps to URL paths:

| File Path | URL Route |
|-----------|-----------|
| `app/page.tsx` | `/` |
| `app/about/page.tsx` | `/about` |
| `app/blog/page.tsx` | `/blog` |
| `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` | `/blog/:slug` (dynamic) |
| `app/api/users/route.ts` | `/api/users` |

Every `page.tsx` file becomes a route. Dynamic segments use `[brackets]`.
