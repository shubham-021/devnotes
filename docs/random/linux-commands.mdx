## Navigation

### pwd (Print Working Directory)

Shows your current location in the file system.

```bash
pwd
# /home/user/projects
```

---

### cd (Change Directory)

Navigate between directories.

```bash
cd /path/to/directory    # Go to absolute path
cd folder                # Go to folder in current directory
cd ..                    # Go up one level
cd ../..                 # Go up two levels
cd ~                     # Go to home directory
cd -                     # Go to previous directory
cd                       # Go to home directory (same as cd ~)
```

---

### ls (List)

List directory contents.

```bash
ls                  # List files and folders
ls -l               # Long format (permissions, owner, size, date)
ls -a               # Show hidden files (starting with .)
ls -la              # Long format + hidden files
ls -lh              # Human-readable file sizes (KB, MB, GB)
ls -lt              # Sort by modification time (newest first)
ls -ltr             # Sort by time, reversed (oldest first)
ls -lS              # Sort by file size (largest first)
ls -R               # Recursive (list subdirectories too)
ls -1               # One file per line
ls *.txt            # List only .txt files
ls -d */            # List only directories
```

#### Understanding ls -l Output

```bash
-rw-r--r-- 1 user group 4096 Jan 15 10:30 file.txt
```

| Part | Example | Meaning |
|------|---------|---------|
| File type | `-` | `-` = file, `d` = directory, `l` = symlink |
| Owner permissions | `rw-` | Read, write, no execute |
| Group permissions | `r--` | Read only |
| Other permissions | `r--` | Read only |
| Hard link count | `1` | Number of hard links |
| Owner | `user` | File owner |
| Group | `group` | File group |
| Size | `4096` | Size in bytes |
| Date | `Jan 15` | Modification date |
| Time | `10:30` | Modification time |
| Name | `file.txt` | Filename |

The first character indicates type:
- `-` = regular file
- `d` = directory
- `l` = symbolic link

cut -d ":" -f 1,3 /etc/passwd    # Fields 1 and 3
cut -c 1-10 file.txt             # Characters 1-10
cut -d " " -f 2- file.txt        # Field 2 to end
```

---

### awk

Pattern scanning and processing (powerful text processing).

```bash
awk '{print $1}' file.txt                    # Print 1st column
awk '{print $1, $3}' file.txt                # Print 1st and 3rd columns
awk -F "," '{print $2}' file.csv             # CSV 2nd column
awk '{print NR, $0}' file.txt                # Add line numbers
awk '/pattern/ {print}' file.txt             # Print matching lines
awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum}' file.txt   # Sum first column
awk 'NR==5' file.txt                         # Print line 5
awk 'NR>=5 && NR<=10' file.txt               # Print lines 5-10
```

---

### sed (Stream Editor)

Transform text.

```bash
sed 's/old/new/' file.txt            # Replace first occurrence per line
sed 's/old/new/g' file.txt           # Replace all occurrences
sed -i 's/old/new/g' file.txt        # Edit file in place
sed -i.bak 's/old/new/g' file.txt    # In place with backup
sed '5d' file.txt                    # Delete line 5
sed '1,5d' file.txt                  # Delete lines 1-5
sed '/pattern/d' file.txt            # Delete lines matching pattern
sed -n '5p' file.txt                 # Print only line 5
sed -n '5,10p' file.txt              # Print lines 5-10
```

---

## Permissions

### chmod (Change Mode)

Change file permissions.

```bash
chmod 755 file.sh            # rwxr-xr-x
chmod 644 file.txt           # rw-r--r--
chmod +x script.sh           # Add execute permission
chmod -w file.txt            # Remove write permission
chmod u+x file.sh            # Add execute for user (owner)
chmod g+w file.txt           # Add write for group
chmod o-r file.txt           # Remove read for others
chmod -R 755 folder          # Recursive
```

#### Permission Numbers

| Number | Permission | Symbol |
|--------|------------|--------|
| 0 | None | --- |
| 1 | Execute | --x |
| 2 | Write | -w- |
| 3 | Write + Execute | -wx |
| 4 | Read | r-- |
| 5 | Read + Execute | r-x |
| 6 | Read + Write | rw- |
| 7 | Read + Write + Execute | rwx |

Common patterns:
- `755` = Owner: rwx, Group: r-x, Others: r-x (scripts, directories)
- `644` = Owner: rw-, Group: r--, Others: r-- (regular files)
- `600` = Owner: rw-, Group: ---, Others: --- (private files)
- `777` = Everyone: rwx (avoid, security risk)

---

### chown (Change Owner)

Change file ownership.

```bash
chown user file.txt              # Change owner
chown user:group file.txt        # Change owner and group
chown :group file.txt            # Change group only
chown -R user:group folder       # Recursive
```

---

## Process Management

### ps (Process Status)

List running processes.

```bash
ps                    # Current user's processes in current terminal
ps aux                # All processes, all users
ps -ef                # Full format listing
ps aux | grep node    # Find specific process
```

---

### top and htop

Interactive process viewer.

```bash
top                   # Real-time process viewer
htop                  # Better interactive viewer (may need to install)

# In top:
# q = quit
# k = kill process (enter PID)
# M = sort by memory
# P = sort by CPU
# 1 = show individual CPUs
```

---

### kill

Terminate processes.

```bash
kill PID              # Send SIGTERM (graceful)
kill -9 PID           # Send SIGKILL (force, immediate)
kill -15 PID          # Send SIGTERM (same as kill PID)
killall processname   # Kill by name
pkill -f "pattern"    # Kill by pattern in command
```

Common signals:
- `1` (SIGHUP) - Reload configuration
- `9` (SIGKILL) - Force kill (cannot be caught)
- `15` (SIGTERM) - Graceful termination (default)

---

### bg, fg, jobs

Background and foreground processes.

```bash
command &             # Run in background
Ctrl+Z                # Suspend current process
bg                    # Resume suspended process in background
fg                    # Bring background process to foreground
jobs                  # List background jobs
fg %1                 # Bring job 1 to foreground
```

---

### nohup

Run command immune to hangups (keeps running after logout).

```bash
nohup command &                      # Run in background, immune to hangup
nohup ./script.sh > output.log 2>&1 &  # With output redirect
```

---

df -i                 # Inode usage
```

---

### du (Disk Usage)

Show directory/file sizes.

```bash
du                        # All directories recursively
du -h                     # Human readable
du -sh *                  # Summary of each item in current dir
du -sh folder             # Summary of single directory
